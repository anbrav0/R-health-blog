    "text": "3 What is a GLM?\n\n3.1 lets start with a quick overview of the simple linear regression\nAs you know, a simple linear regression has two major components: a Y, dependent outcome and an X, which is your independent or your predictor variable. the model looks something like this:\nE(Y|X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 where \\beta_0 is your intercept and \\beta_1 is your slope. A linear model is a function, that us used to fit a data. We often use this method to see the association, or strength in association between two variables of interest:\n\n\nCode\n# load data:\ndata(trees)\n\n#rename variables:\nnames(trees) <- c(\"DBH_in\",\"height_ft\", \"volume_ft3\")\n\n# simple model:\nmodel <- lm(DBH_in ~ height_ft, data = trees)\n\n# plot:\nsimple_trees <-\n  #data\n  ggplot(data = trees) +\n  \n  # x and y\n  aes(x = height_ft, y = DBH_in) + \n  \n  #labels\n  labs(title = \"Example of Simple Association - Using Trees Data\",\n       x = \"Height in feet\",\n       y = \"Diameter in inches\") + \n  \n  # add points\n  geom_point() + \n  \n  # add the lm\n  geom_smooth(method = \"lm\", color = \"blue\", se = FALSE) +\n  \n  # add a simple theme\n  theme_bw()\n\n# actual plot: \nsimple_trees\n\n\n\n\n\nOften you will find this model writen in this form:\n E(Y|X) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 + \\varepsilon where \\beta_0 and \\beta_1 are our coefficients that need to be estimated and $ $ used for more complex lines Our goal is to see the association between an outcome with an exposure.\n\n\n3.2 Assumptions of a linear question\nBefore diving into the generalized models, lets quickly overview the assumptions of linear regression.\n\nAssumption 1: for each combination of independent variable x, y is a random variable with a certain probability distribution.\nAssumption 2: Y values are statistical dependent.\nAssumption 3: the mean value of Y, for each specific combination of values of X, is a linear function.\nAssumption 4: the variance of Y, is the same for any fixed value of X_n\nAssumption 5: for any fixed combination of X_n, Y is normally distributed.\n\nSomething to note, that in the simple explanation above we are assuming our Y variable (remember one of the points we talked above above? that y holds a specific distribution!) is continuous. So lets talk about our Y variable having a count distribution.\n\n\n3.3 lets talk about the generalized linear model\nthe term “generalized” is a big umbrella term used to describe a large class of models. Our response variable y_i is following an exponential family distribution with a mean of u_i which is sometimes non-linear! However McCallagh and Nelder considered them to be linear because our covariate affect the distribution of y_i only through linear combination.\nthere are three major components of a GLM:\n\nA Random component: which specifies the probability distribution of our response variable\nSystematic component: specifies the explanatory variable (x_1 .. x_n) in our model. Or their linear combination (\\beta_0 + \\beta_1) etc.\na link function: specifies the LINK between the random and systematic components. This helps us figure out our expected values of the response is related to the linear combination of our explanatory variables. for example the link function g(u) = u, which is called an identity function. this models the mean directly. Or, in the case we will talk about today the log of the mean:\n\n log(\\pmb{\\mu}) = \\alpha + \\beta_1x_1 + ... B_nx_n + \\epsilon\n\n\n3.4 What is a Poisson Regression?\na Poisson regression models how the mean of a discrete (or we can say count too!) response variable Y depends on our explanatory X variables. Here is a simple look at the Poisson regression:\n  log \\lambda_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta x_i  where the random component: the distribution of Y is the mean of \\lambda and the systematic component is the explanatory variable (or your X variables, which can be continuous or categorical) that is linearly associated. Or can be transformed if non-linear, and the link function is the log link stated in the section above (link the section number here?)\nAn advantage of using GLM over a normal line model is the link function gives us more flexibility in modeling and this model uses the Maximum likelihood estimate. Additionally we can use different inference tools like Wald’s test for logistic and Poisson models.\n\n\n3.5 important points of Poisson models\n\nwe can use this type of link function by using count data. count data can be describes at the number of devices that can access the internet, number of sex partners you have in your lifetime, and the number of individuals infected with a disease.\nPoisson is unimodel and skewed to the right, both the mean and the variance are the same. In other words, when the count is larger it tends to be more varied.\nif our mew increases the skew decreases and the distribution starts to become more bell shapped. our mean tends to look something like this:\n\n\\pmb{\\mu} = exp(\\alpha + \\beta x) = e^\\alpha (e^\\beta)^x  where one unit increase in X has a multiplicative impact on your e^\\beta power on the mean. (More on this a little later in the interpretation section!)\n\n\n3.6 one last point before we move on\nwhen your modeling count data, the link scale is linear. So the effects are additive on the link. While your response scale is nonlinear (this is on the exponent) and so the effects are multiplicative. makes sense? we will work out an example now!"

This particular test is used to obtain the probability of the combination of frequencies that we can actually obtain.\n\n\nWhat is a contingency table?\nThis is a table that shows the distribution of a variable in the rows and columns. Sometimes referred to as a 2x2 table. They are useful in summarizing categorical variables. The table() function is used to create a contingency table in R. When the variables of interest are summarized in a contingency table it is easier to run the Fisher’s Exact test.\n\nExample: Creating a contingency table\nLets say we have information on the gender of participants in a clinical trial and the type of drug administered to them we can create the following contingency table for further analysis.\n\n\nCode\n# Example R code to create a contingency table\n\n# Creating a data frame\n df = data.frame (\n   \"Drug\" = c(\"Drug A\", \"Drug B\", \"Drug A\"),\n   \"Gender\" = c(\"Male\", \"Male\", \"Female\")\n )\n \n# Creating contingency table using table()\n ctable = table(df)\n print(ctable)\n\n\n        Gender\nDrug     Female Male\n  Drug A      1    1\n  Drug B      0    1\n\n\n\n\n\nPerforming Fisher’s Exact Test in R\nWe will need to install the ggstatplot package to visualize the statistical results.\n\n\nCode\n#install.packages(\"ggstatplot\") \n#install.packages(\"summarytools\")\n#install.packages(\"gmodels\")\n#install.packages(\"gt\")\n#install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\n\n\n\n\nData Source: GMP2017\nFor this example we will be using the Greater Manchester Police’s UK stop and search data from 2017(December) sourced from the Sage Research Methods Dataset Part 2.

In other words, males are more likely of getting stopped and searched than females.\n\n\nVisualizing statistical results with plots using ggstatsplot\n\nwe download the ggsattsplot package to visualize the results in a plot.\n\n\n\nCode\n# Fisher's exact test \n\ntest <- fisher.test(cGMP17)\n\n# combine plot and statistical test with ggbarstats\n\nggbarstats(\n newGMP17_nom2, Gender, ObjectSearch,\n results.subtitle = FALSE,\n subtitle = paste0(\n \"Fisher's exact test\", \", p-value = \",\n ifelse(test$p.value < 0.001, \"< 0.001\", round(test$p.value, 3))\n  )\n )\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot, it is clear that the proportion of males among object search events is higher compared to females, suggesting that there is a relationship between the two variables.\nThis is confirmed thanks to the p-value displayed in the subtitle of the plot. As previously, we reject the null hypothesis and we conclude that the variables gender and stop and search events are not dependent (p-value = 0.038)."

In other words, when the count is larger it tends to be more varied.\nif our mew increases the skew decreases and the distribution starts to become more bell shapped. our mean tends to look something like this:\n\n\\pmb{\\mu} = exp(\\alpha + \\beta x) = e^\\alpha (e^\\beta)^x  where one unit increase in X has a multiplicative impact on your e^\\beta power on the mean. (More on this a little later in the interpretation section!)\n\n\n3.6 A few last points before we move on\nLike with different models in statistics, one must follow the assumptions of a regression, and yes, Poisson has them as well. The assumptions for a Poisson regression are as follows:\n\nYour Y (dependent values) must be count values.\nCount values must have a positive integer (or who numbers) (0, 1, 2, 3, ... k). Negative values will not work here.\nexplanatory variables can be continuous, dichotomous or ordinal\nOur count variable must follow a Poisson distribution that is, the mean and variance should be the same. remember this one!\n\n \\pmb{\\mu} = E(X) = \\lambda    \\sigma^2 = \\lambda \nwhen your modeling count data, the link scale is linear. So the effects are additive on the link. While your response scale is nonlinear (this is on the exponent) and so the effects are multiplicative. makes sense? we will work out an example now!"

    "text": "2 What is a Random Intercept model?\nBefore talking about a random intercept model, let’s understand why they are necessary and important in the real world by discussing a variance component model first. This will make sense as we go along in this lecture!\n\n2.1 Variance component model\nWe are familiar with a fixed level of a factor or variable. Which means that the factor level in an experiment is the only thing we are interested. For example, let’s say we are interested in measuring the difference in resistance resulting from putting identical resistors to three different temperatures for a period of 24 hours. Let’s say we have three different groups, and each of these three different groups have a sample size of 5. So each of the three treatment groups was replicated 5 times.\n\n\n\nLevel 1\nLevel 2\nLevel 3\n\n\n\n\n6.9\n8.3\n8.0\n\n\n5.4\n6.8\n10.5\n\n\n5.8\n7.8\n8.1\n\n\n4.6\n9.2\n6.9\n\n\n4.0\n6.5\n9.3\n\n\nmean\nmean\nmean\n\n\n5.34\n7.72\n8.56\n\n\n\nIn this example, the level of the temperature is considered fixed meaning, the three temperatures were the only ones that we are interested in. This is called a fixed effects model.\na fixed effect model is a statistical model in which the parameters are fixed or non-random. This can also be referred to a regression model, in which group mean are “fixed” (non-random) or in simpler, terms something that is “fixed” in analysis is constant like sex assigned at birth or ethnicity.\n Y_{it} = \\beta_1X_{1,it} + ... + \\beta_kX_{k,it}+\\alpha_i + u_{it} \nwith i =1...n and t=1...T and the \\alpha_i are specific intercepts that capture heterogeneity across.\nNow, let’s say we want to look at different levels of factors that were chosen because of random sampling, like number of operators working that day, lot batches, days etc. So in this case we are now regarding factors not related to themselves (variables) but we are now trying to represent all possible levels that these factors may take, the appropriate model is now a random effects model.\nfitting these random effects models are important because we want to obtain estimates of different contributions that experimental factors make to the variability of our data! (we can represent this as the variance) this is what is called variance component\n\n\n2.2 Why is this relavant?\nWell, a variance component model helps us see how much variance in ou response at the different levels. But what if you are interested in seeing the effects of the explanatory variables?\n\n\n2.3 Example 2: School level data\nLet’s say we have some data on exam results of students within a school and we use a variance component model and see that 15% of the variance is at the school level. Like for example, differing school districts, differing school policies etc. However, is it fair to really say that 15% of the variance in example scores is caused by schools? you could also say that maybe that part of the variance could be cause by the students being different themselves as well before taking the exam.\nIn this case, it might be important to control for the previous exams the students took, so you can look at the variance that is due to the things that happened when the students were at that school.\n\n\n2.4 Fitting a single-level regression model"

    "text": "This is also called the independent sample t test. It is used to see whether the unknown population means of two groups are equal or different. This test requires one variable which can be the exposure x and another variable which can be the outcome y. If you have more than two groups then analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be more suitable. If data is nonparametric then an alternative test to use would be the Mann Whitney U test or a permutation test.[@cressie1986].\nThere are two types of t tests, the first being the Student’s t test, which assumes the variance of the two groups is equal, the second being the Welch’s t test (default in R), which assumes the variance in the two groups is different.\nIn this article we will be discussing the Student’s t test.\n\n\n\nMeasurements for one observation do not affect measurements for any other observation (assumes independence).\nData in each group must be obtained via a random sample from the population.\nData in each group are normally distributed.\nData values are continuous.\nThe variances for the two independent groups are equal in the Student’s t test.\nThere should be no significant outliers.\n\n\n\n\n\n(H_0): the mean of group A (m_A) is equal to the mean of group B (m_B)- two tailed test.\n(H_0): the mean of group A (m_A) is greater than or equal to mean of group B (m_B)- one tailed test.\n(H_0): the mean of group A (m_A) is less than or eaqual to the mean of group B (m_B)- one tailed test.\nThe corresponding alternative hypotheses would be as follows:\n\n\n\n(H_1): the mean of group A (m_A) is different to the mean of group B (m_B)- two tailed test.\n(H_1): the mean of group A (m_A) is less than the mean of group B (m_B)- one tailed test.\n(H_1): the mean of group A (m_A) is greater the mean of group B (m_B)- one tailed test.\n\n\n\n\nFor the Student’s t test which assumes equal variance the following is how the |t| statistic may be calculated using groups A and B as examples:\nt ={ {m_{A} - m_{B}} \\over \\sqrt{ {S^2 \\over n_{A} } + {S^2 \\over n_{B}} }}\nThis can be described as the sample mean difference divided by the sample standard deviation of the sample mean difference where:\nm_A and m_B are the mean values of A and B,\nn_A and n_B are the seize of group A and B,\nS^2 is the estimator for the pooled variance,\nwith the degrees of freedom (df) = n_A + n_B - 2,\nand S^2 is calculated as follows:\nS^2 = { {\\sum{ (x-m_{A})^2} + \\sum{ (x-m_{B})^2}} \\over {n_{A} + n_{B} - 2 }}\nResults for both Students t test and Welch’s t test are usually similar unless the group sizes and standard deviations are different.\nWhat if the data is not independent?\nIf the data is not independent such as paired data in the form of matched pairs which are correlated, we use the paired t test. This test checks whether the means of two paired groups are different from each other. It usually used in clinical trial studies with a “before and after” or case control studies with matched pairs. For this test we only assume the difference of each pair to be normally distributed (the paired groups are important for analysis) unlike the independent t test which assumes that data from both samples are independent and variances are equal.[@fralick]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntidyverse: data manipulation and visualization.\nrstatix: providing pipe friendly R functions for easy statistical analyses.\ncar: providing variance tests.\n\n\n\nCode\n#install.packages(\"ggstatplot\") \n#install.packages(\"car\")\n#install.packages(\"rstatix\")\n#install.packages(tidyVerse)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis example dataset sourced from kaggle was obtained from surveys of students in math and Portuguese classes in secondary school.

The final score across both is almost evenly distributed. However there seem to be a significant number of individuals who failed the test (grade=0).\n\n\nCode\n# plotting bar plot to see the distribution in sample size\nsample_size = table(math$sex)\nbarplot(sample_size,main= \"Distribution of sample size by sex\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bar plot shows that there are slightly more females in the sample than males.\nIdentifying outliers\n\n\nCode\n# creating a boxplot to visualize the outliers (G3=0)\nboxplot(G3 ~ sex,data=math)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe box plot shows us that there are outliers in terms of people who had a score of 0. This score is not truly reflective of the performance between boys and girls as a grade of 0 may represent absentia or other reasons for the test not been taken. Therefore we opt to drop the outliers. We will compare to see if this decision affects the mean which appears similar from the above plot.\n\n\nCode\n# creating a boxplot to visualize the data with no outliers\nmath2 = subset(math, G3>0)\nboxplot(G3 ~ sex,data=math2)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe mean has increased slightly but the distribution is still the same.\nCheck the equality of variances (homogeneity)\nWe can use the Levene’s test or the Bartlett’s test to check for homogeneity of variances. The former is in the car library and the later in the rstatix library. If the variances are homogeneous the p value will be greater than 0.05.\nOther tests include F test 2 sided, Brown-Forsythe and O’Brien but we shall not cover these.\n\n\nCode\n# running the Bartleet's test to check equal variance\nbartlett.test(G3~sex, data=math2)\n\n\n\n    Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances\n\ndata:  G3 by sex\nBartlett's K-squared = 0.12148, df = 1, p-value = 0.7274\n\n\nCode\n# running the Levene's test to check equal variance\nmath2 %>% levene_test(G3~sex)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 4\n    df1   df2 statistic     p\n  <int> <int>     <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1   355     0.614 0.434\n\n\nThe p value is greater than 0.05 suggesting there is no difference between the variances of the two groups.\n\n\n\n\nData is continuous(G3)\nData is normally distributed\nData is independent (males and females distinct not the same individual)\nNo significant outliers\nThere are equal variances\n\nAs the assumptions are met we go ahead to perform the Student’s t test.\n\n\n\nSince the default is the Welch t test we use the \\color{blue}{\\text{var.eqaul = TRUE }} code to signify a Student’s t test. There is a t.test() function in stats package and a t_test() in the rstatix package. For this analysis we use the rstatix method as it comes out as a table.\n\n\nCode\n# perfoming the two sample t test\nstat.test <- math2 %>% \n  t_test(G3~ sex, var.equal=TRUE) %>%\n  add_significance()\nstat.test\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 9\n  .y.   group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic    df      p p.signif\n  <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int>     <dbl> <dbl>  <dbl> <chr>   \n1 G3    F      M        185   172     -1.94   355 0.0531 ns      \n\n\n\n\nCode\nstat.test$statistic\n\n\n        t \n-1.940477 \n\n\nThe results are represented as follows;\n\ny - dependent variable\ngroup1, group 2 - compared groups(independent variables)\ndf - degrees of freedom\np - p value\n\n\\color{pink}{\\text{gtsummary}} table of results\n\n\nCode\n  math2 |> \n  tbl_summary(\n    by = sex,\n    statistic =\n      list(\n        all_continuous() ~ \"{mean} ({sd})\",\n        all_dichotomous() ~ \"{p}%\")\n    ) |> \n   add_n() |> \n  add_overall() |> \n  add_difference()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n      Characteristic\n      N\n      Overall, N = 3571\n      F, N = 1851\n      M, N = 1721\n      Difference2\n      95% CI2,3\n      p-value2\n    \n  \n  \n    G3\n357\n12 (3)\n11 (3)\n12 (3)\n-0.66\n-1.3, 0.01\n0.053\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Mean (SD)\n    \n    \n      2 Welch Two Sample t-test\n    \n    \n      3 CI = Confidence Interval\n    \n  \n\n\n\n\nInterpretation of results\nFor the two sample t test with t(355) = -1.940477, p < 0.0531, the p value is greater than our alpha of 0.05 , we fail to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is no difference between the means of the two groups. There is no difference in final grades between boys and girls.\nEffect size\nCohen’s d can be an used as an effect size statistic for the two sample t test. It is the difference between the means of each group divided by the pooled standard deviation.\nd= {m_A-m_B \\over SD_{pooled}}\nIt ranges from 0 to infinity, with 0 indicating no effect where the means are equal. 0.5 means that the means differ by half the standard deviation of the data and 1 means they differ by 1 standard deviation. It is divided into small, medium or large using the following cut off points.\n\nsmall 0.2-<0.5\nmedium 0.5-<0.8\nlarge >=0.8\n\nFor the above test the following is how we can find the effect size;\n\n\nCode\n#perfoming cohen's d\nmath2 %>% \n  cohens_d(G3~sex,var.equal = TRUE)\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  .y.   group1 group2 effsize    n1    n2 magnitude\n* <chr> <chr>  <chr>    <dbl> <int> <int> <ord>    \n1 G3    F      M       -0.206   185   172 small    \n\n\nThe effect size is small d= -0.20.\nIn conclusion, a two-samples t-test showed that the difference was not statistically significant, t(355) = -1.940477, p < 0.0531, d = -0.20; where, t(355) is shorthand notation for a t-statistic that has 355 degrees of freedom and d is Cohen’s d.\nWhat if it is one tailed t test?\nUse the \\color{blue}{\\text{alternative =}} option to determine if one group is \\color{blue}{\\text{\"less\"}} or \\color{blue}{\\text{\"greater\"}}. For example if we want to see whether the final grades for females are greater than males we can use the following code:\n\n\nCode\n# perfoming the one tailed two sample t test\nstat.test <- math2 %>% \n  t_test(G3~ sex, var.equal=TRUE, alternative = \"greater\") %>%\n  add_significance()\nstat.test\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 9\n  .y.   group1 group2    n1    n2 statistic    df     p p.signif\n  <chr> <chr>  <chr>  <int> <int>     <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>   \n1 G3    F      M        185   172     -1.94   355 0.973 ns      \n\n\nThe p value > 0.05 (p=0.973) , we fail to reject the null hypothesis. We conclude that the final grades for females are not significantly greater than for males.\nWhat about running the paired sample t test?\nWe can simply add the syntax \\color{blue}{\\text{paired= TRUE}} to our t_test() to run the analysis for matched pairs data.\n\n\n\n\nThis article covers the Student’s t test and how we run it in R. It also shows how we find the effect size and how we can conclude the results.\n\n\n\n\nCortez, Paulo, and Alice Maria Gonçalves Silva. 2008. “Using data mining to predict secondary school student performance.” In.
